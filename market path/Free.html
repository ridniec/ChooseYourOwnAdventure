    Let the lady Stay
  </h2>
  <p>
    You decided to not take the lady away and finished treating the wound. But it was not effective. She became a zombie. You were attacked and the cycle has begun again.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are dead.
   </p>
  <p>
    Man you a loser. Goodluck when a zombie apocalypse comes.
