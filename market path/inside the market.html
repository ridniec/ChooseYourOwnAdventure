    Inside the Market
  </h2>
  <p>
    You enter the market, its dark and trashed. You and your roommate split up. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
  <li>Food</li>
  <li>Clothes</li>
  <li>Water</li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    When searching the isles you come across a man, hes on the ground and groaning. He sounds hurt. What do you do?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="/market path/man.html">Go up and check on him</a>
  </p>
    or
  <p>
    <a href="/market path/avoid.html">Avoid him and try to find your roommate</a>
